Auto-wiring

For dependency injection, spring can use auto wiring
Sprint will look for a class that matches the property - matches by type class or interface
Spring will inject it automatically, therefore its auto-wired
Spring will scan all the components and looks for anyone that wanna implement our service, If so, spring fill inject it automatically.

Auto-wiring injection types
* Constructor injection
* Setter injections
* Field injections

Constructor injection
* Define the dependency interface or class
* Create a constructor in your class for injections
* Configure the dependency injection with @Autowired Annotation

Setter Injection
Inject dependency using setter methods on our class
* Create a setter method for injections
* Configure the dependency using the Autowired annotation

Method Injection
Inject dependencies by calling any method in our class

Field Injection - Inject dependency by setting the field values on your class directly
