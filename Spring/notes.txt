Singleton
Spring container creates only one instance of the bean, by default. It is cached in memory. All request foe the bean will return a shared reference to the same bean.

Spring bean scopes
* singleton - creates a single shared instance of the bean.
* prototype - creates a new bean instance for each container request.
* request - scoped to an HTTP request. Only used for web apps.
* session - scoped to an HTTP session. Only used for web apps.
* global-session - scoped to a global HTTP session. Only for web apps.

Bean Lifecycle

Container start ==> Bean Instantiated ==> DI ==> Internal Spring processing ==> Your custom init method ==> Bean ready for use ==> your custom destroy method ==> Stop

You can add custom code during bean initialization. You can add custom code during bean destruction as well. These are called hooks.

Annotations
Special Labels/markers added to Java Classes
* Provide meta-data about the class
* Processed at compile time or run time for special processing

Why use configurations with annotations
* XML configuration can be verbose
* Configure your spring beans with annotations
* Annotations can minimize the XML configurations

Scanning for Component Class
* Spring will scan your java classes for special annotations
* Automatically register the bean in the spring container

Development Process
1) Enable component scanning in spring config file
2) Add the @Component Annotation to your Java Classes
3) Retrieve the bean from the Spring container
